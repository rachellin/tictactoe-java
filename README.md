# Tic Tac Toe Java
A simple, terminal-based tic-tac-toe game written in Java. 

The game is played on a 3 x 3 grid by default, but the grid size can be changed in the Main class file. 
Each move by a user is made by entering the row and column coordinates of the spot; the rows and columns start indexing at 0 (first row, second column input: `0 1`). The user can play again after a winner or tie is announced. 

**Players:**
Human vs. Human
Human vs. Computer (random moves)
Human vs. "AI" (take wins, block wins, use 3-corners strategy)

## Project Status
**bugs/errors to fix/catch:**
- user inputs index out of bounds for row/column

**features to be implemented:**
- more strategies for the "AI Player" 
- allow user to decide on grid size during the game (as opposed to changing the size in the Main class file)
